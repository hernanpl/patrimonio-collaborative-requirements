# Verifiable User Requirements

- Based on user stories
- Unambiguous
- Testable
- Atomic
- Implementation free

# Issues
Issues should be used to ask additional questions of the team. If you have questions or see issues with the way a requirement is written you may create an issue for it or if you have a suggestion, use a pull request.
